##ABILITIES

###Gravity gun - shoot(LMB)
A huge gun that shoots packages. Each package (50dmg) applies a forward push to the target. Special packages do additional damage (+100).  

**Magazine size**: 5  
**Damage**: 50-150.  
**Speed**: 1s.

*An industrial gravity gun, modified to shoot things. Low initial damage, goes up a lot with special packages. Packages are slow projectiles, but they have a lot of weight, meaning they push the target on impact.*

###Gravity gun - tractor beam (RMB)
Shoots a beam that attracts/repulse the target. The farther he is, the weaker the force of attraction/repulsion.  
Uses a charge that depletes on use.  Regenerate after 1 second of not use.
Change mode with mouse wheel.    
If the target is at **normal gravity** you will attract/repulse each other.  
A target at **0G** will be attracted/repulsed immediately to you.  
A target at **1000G** will not move, you will be attracted to/repulsed from the target.  

**Charge**: 10s  
**Regeneration**: 10%/s

*A Gravity Gun without a tractor beam is just a bad idea, period.*

###Gravity gun - collect (Passive)
Dead heroes drop their stuff on the floor. Collect it to fill your magazine with special packages.  

*This ensure that he's not a frontline damage dealer, but that he'll need to wait for other heroes to "break the ice". This special packages will be skinned as the dead hero you picked up).*

###Bownling ball satchel swing (Melee)
Hit the target in the chin with his bowling ball, apply a small force upwards.

*To restore hierarchy and respect.*

Hold to shot on yourself.  
Lasts 5 seconds.  
Cooldown 10 seconds.

*Hits will easily move the target (move a tank), targets on air won't go back on the ground (bonus for allied Pharah, malus for enemy Junkrat's bombs or when he's flying with his bomb), a target that jump will jump indefinetly*

Hold to shot on yourself.  
Lasts 5 seconds.

*Flying enemy targets will fall on the ground for 5 dmg/ meter, flying allied target will cause 5 dmg / meter to enemies on the ground (heavier heroes = more damages), target on the ground will move slower and won't be able to jump, ability that move the target won't have effect*

###Bowling ball (Ult)
Put his lucky bowling ball in the gravity gun.   
A target at 0G hit with this ball will go flying. Him and everyone he hits will suffer 300dmg.  
A target at normal gravity will suffer 400dmg.  
A target at 100G hit will suffer 1000dmg.
