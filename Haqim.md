##ABILITIES

His design rotates around the concept of **poisoned** enemies. Haqim has an average damage against non-poisoned targets, but a high damage against poisoned ones. Widowmaker's trap or Ana's darts and bombs cause the target to be poisoned.

###Preying on the weak (Passive)
Poisoned heroes are highlighted in red on your screen. 10% of damage done to poisoned targets is transfered to Haqim as healt.

*"Poisoning the targets is REALLY important for Haqim."*

###Spider fingers (Passive)
Holding Space while touching a wall or ceiling will attach you to it. You can walk at 50% of normal speed while attached to a wall or ceiling. Damages detach him from the wall.

*"Reinforces the idea of a spider like character. Gives Haqim a great freedom of movement, for flanking or staying away from enemies."*

###Poison dart(LMB)
He uses a blowgun, loaded with poison darts. Each dart obscure the target vision a little more. Dart's effect stuck, up to 4. Poisoned targets take addition damage. Targets with 3 dart's effect are considered poisoned. 

**Magazine size**: 1  
**Damage**: 25-50/sec.  
**Duration**: 4 sec.  
**Speed**: 1s.

*"200 healt targets are dead if hitted twice, tanks take more hits, but they will be poisoned (making them a prey -> healing you).   
The obscured vision adds alayer of difficulty to the target."*

###Whip (RMB, Melee)
A long whip that hits the target. If the target is poisoned, no damage is done, but the whip hits target's feet and he falls to the ground for 2 seconds. 

**Range**: 3m  

*"Similar in concept to Mccree stun, but with a soft cooldown (determined by target's status)."*

###Poison pot (E)
Throws a pot full of poison. Targets are considered as poisoned.

**Damage**: 50  
**Duration**: 5 seconds.
**Radius**: 3 m  
**Cooldown**: 10 seconds  
 
*"This should be his opener. Hit a bunch of targets with this, shoot up to 4 darts with the blowgun, hello emote while they die."*

###Leap (Shift)
Perform a huge leap in the direction he's facing. 

**Cooldown**: 7 seconds

*"This is a mobility helper and a powerful tactical device: shoot someone, leap away while the poison does his job."*

###Poison Cloud (Ult)
Throws a pot that on impact creates a huge cloud of poison gas. There is no visibility inside the cloud. Targets are considered as poisoned.

**Radius**: 15m
**Damage**: 50 per second
**Duration**: 10 seconds

*"Low damage per second allow enemies to run away, unless Haqim jumps in and whip them, while they're blind. Works as CC and damage dealing."*
