##ABILITIES
###Energy fountain (Passive)
You and all friendly heroes around you will regenerate their shields at double rate.

*"Not an actual heal, just a boost"*

###Fluctuate (Jump)
By holding Jump you move horizontally, even if there is no floor underneath.

*"Look ma, no floor!"*

###Energy blast (LMB)
You create a channel of energy between you and you target, stealing his life. It works great against shield, not so much against other kind of hp. Target mechanics similar to Symmetra.

**Damage**: 40/s or 70/s (against shield)    
**Regenerate**: half of the stolen life 

*"Low damage, but you're healed by it."*

###Channel Energy (RMB)
Transfer your shield to the deployed barrier, healing it (it heals double of what you transfer). You can't die because of this.  
 
**Regeneration**: 100/sec  
**Range**: 10 m

*"This will be crucial in fights, when he has to juggle his barrier health and his own"*

###Energy Barrier (E)
You place down a barrier (2m long, 1.5m high). Nothing hostile goes through. You won't be able to move it, but you can disengage it. 

**Shield**: 500  
**Duration**: indefinite  
**Cooldown**: 10 seconds from deactivation or destruction  
 
*"His main ability. He will be able to alleviate Reinhardt's most boring work, turret's body guard. He should take care of his barrier (he can heal it).  
Placing it in a narrow passage means he can CC (Mei style)."*

###Dematerialize (Shift)
Change enemy's health and armor to shields. 

**Cooldown**: 10 seconds

*"This is an important combo for him. Both his main weapon and his ulti works great when there is an enemy with shields nearby, so this should be his opener in most situations.  
WARNING: This could be a buff for the target."*

###Energy network (Ult)
You jump on an ally and wrap him with your energy. All damage done to you will be distributed among enemies' shields, if there is no enemy with shields, you divide the damage between you two.

**Radius**: 30m  
**Duration**: 6 seconds

*"No direct damage, but you will protect an ally, while deplenishing enemies' resources."*
