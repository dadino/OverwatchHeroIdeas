#Tanky
##Appearance
[A four legged tank](http://imgur.com/a/0gVwJ) with energy shields and turrets on his head. Build in the early stages of the Omni War, he was captured and reprogrammed.  
He was dropped from the sky, right in the center of enemy squadrons, where he would hold enough time to charge and fire his EMP.

###Cannon (LMB)
You use a huge cannon. That's all, folks!

**Magazine size**: 1  
**Damage**: 100  
**Radius**: 2m   
**Speed**: 2s

*"Standard issue 20mm explosive rounds, nothing too fancy."*

###Circular shields (RMB)
Deploy 4 indipendent shields, forming a circle around you.  

**Radius**: 3 m  
**Health**: 1000 each  
**Regeneration**: 50/sec  
**Reactivation**: 5 sec

*"Since his role is 360 defender, a 360 shield system seems appropriate."*

###VTOL (E)
You ignite the rocket on the bottom of your chassis. After 2 seconds you take off, in a cloud of smoke. Enemies in the rocket blast will be pushed away. You can control the flight with WASD.

**Duration**: 2 seconds of ignition, 3 seconds of flight-time  
**Cooldown**: 20 seconds  
 
*"His cannon could become a real pain in the ass if he's in an unreachable position, surrounded by shields and protected by auto turrets. He could also use this to place himself in the center of a fight and fire his EMP.  
I'M OUT MOTHERF&&&R!!"*

###Auto-turrets (Shift)
Toggle 2 automatic turrets on your back. While the shields are active, they can only shoot targets above the shields' line. 

**Health**: 150hp each  
**Damage**: 50/sec each  
**Deploy**: 1.5 seconds  
**Regeneration**: 30/second  
**Reactivation**: 10 seconds

*"He's built to be right in center of the fight, someone need to have his back."*

###EMP (Ult)
An electric blast shuts down everything around you. Enemies won't be able to use weapons, abilities or ultimates for 5 seconds.

**Radius**: 15m

*"No direct damage, to keep the idea of a low damage kit. Huge survivability improvement for him and his team."*
